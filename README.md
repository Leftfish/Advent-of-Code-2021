# Advent of Code 2021

Again I'm trying to find out how far I can make it in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/). Results so far:
* 2018: 9 days
* 2019: 13 days
* 2020: 25 days for the first time!

I have no idea if I can devote as much time to solving puzzles as last year and if my feeble skills can hold up against this year's tasks. But let's give it a try.

Things I **L**earned, **R**evised or **I**mproved at in 2021:

* [Day 1](01/d01.py): I don't know, list comprehensions and list slicing in Python(**R**), perhaps?
