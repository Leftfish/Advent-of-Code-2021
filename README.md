# Advent of Code 2021

Again I'm trying to find out how far I can make it in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/). Results so far:
* 2018: 9 days
* 2019: 13 days
* 2020: 25 days for the first time!

I have no idea if I can devote as much time to solving puzzles as last year and if my feeble skills can hold up against this year's tasks. But let's give it a try.

Things I **L**earned, **R**evised or **I**mproved at in 2021:

* [Day 1](01/d01.py): using zip(**R**) and list comprehensions in Python(**R**)
* [Day 2](02/d02.py): using complex numbers in Python(**L**)
* [Day 3](03/d03.py): basic set operations in Python(**R**), typing hints in Python(**I**) and operator module(**R**)
* [Day 4](04/d04.py): parsing strings(**R**)
* [Day 5](05/d05.py): using regular expressions(**R**) and drawing plots in matplotlib(**L**)
* [Day 6](06/d06.py): using deques(**R**)
* [Day 7](07/d07.py): Gauss's formula(**R**) and I got to know that statistics module is thing in Python(**L**)
* [Day 8](08/d08.py): set operations(**R**) and frozenset in Pyton(**L**)
* [Day 9](09/d09.py): using iterative BFS (**R**) and recursive DFS(**R**) to find islands in a 2D matrix (**L**)
* [Day 10](10/d10.py): using stacks(**R**)
* [Day 11](11/d11.py): some very basic OOP principles(**R**) but the code needs a lot of cleaning up
* [Day 12](12/d12.py): DFS(**I**) and "yield from" in Python (**L**)
* [Day 13](13/d13.py): slicing 2d NumPy arrays (**L**) and avoiding 2d arrays altogether thanks to dictionaries or sets (**I**)
* [Day 14](14/d14.py): that you don't actually have to store everything that you count (**I**)
* [Day 15](15/d15.py): Dijkstra's algorithm, finally! (**L**)
* [Day 16](16/d16.py): oooof, this was a tough one; managed to do part 1 without help - and learn a lot about recursion on the way (**L**), but only looking at another solution helped be represent the tree structure properly (**L**)
* [Day 17](17/d17.py): using regex to extract negative integers from string (**R**)
