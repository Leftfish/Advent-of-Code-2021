# Advent of Code 2021

Again I'm trying to find out how far I can make it in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/). Results so far:
* 2018: 9 days
* 2019: 13 days
* 2020: 25 days for the first time!

I have no idea if I can devote as much time to solving puzzles as last year and if my feeble skills can hold up against this year's tasks. But let's give it a try.

Things I **L**earned, **R**evised or **I**mproved at in 2021:

* [Day 1](01/d01.py): zip(**R**) and list comprehensions in Python(**R**)
* [Day 2](02/d02.py): complex numbers in Python(**L**)
* [Day 3](03/d03.py): basic set operations in Python(**R**), typing hints in Python(**I**) and operator module(**R**)
* [Day 4](04/d04.py): parsing strings(**R**)
* [Day 5](05/d05.py): regular expressions(**R**) and drawing plots in matplotlib(**L**)
* [Day 6](06/d06.py): deques(**R**)
* [Day 7](07/d07.py): Euler's formula(**R**) - there must be a more efficient way to solve this day...
